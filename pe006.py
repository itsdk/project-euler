# Solution to http://projecteuler.net/problem=6 by Matthew Pepers


#returns the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers
def sum_of_squares(n):
    pass

#returns the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers   
def square_of_sum(n):
    pass


#Test:
#returns the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum of the first 100 natural numbers
n = 100
return sum_of_squares(n) - square_of_sum(n)
